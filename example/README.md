This is an example of the renderer component.

To install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install # npm run example:install outside this folder
```
And then launch a web server:
```
npm run serve
```
Or bundle the app:
```
npm run build
```

If you're in a folder outside `example`, you can prefix the script names with `example:`, i.e. `npm run example:serve` instead of `npm run serve`.
